        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or 
            fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness,
             and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination.
              Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral
               definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this
                process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural 
                heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of 
                learners,
                 skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal education takes place in education and
             training.....

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists belonging to diverse fields.[6][7][8] 
            Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.[9] 
            But they often include other aims as well, such as fostering skills and character traits.[9][6][10] However, there are deep disagreements 
            about the exact nature of education besides these general characteristics. According to some conceptions, it is primarily a process that 
            occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning.[11][12][7] Others understand it not as a process but as the achievement or product
             brought about by this process. On this view, education is what educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic
              of them.[11][12][7] However, the term may also refer to the academic study of the methods and processes taking place during teaching and learning, as
               well as the social institutions involved in these processes.[12] Etymologically, the word "education" is derived from the Latin word ēducātiōn....

                    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is commonly subdivided into different types. The most common subdivision is between
                         formal, 
                        non-formal, and informal education.[35][36][7][37] However, some theorists only distinguish between formal and informal
                         education.[38] A process of teaching constitutes formal education if it happens in a complex institutionalized framework. 
                         Such frameworks are usually chronologically and hierarchically organized as in modern schooling systems, which have different 
                         classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from primary school to university.
